## Introduction

Welcome to the **Solar System Model** project! This web application offers an immersive and interactive 3D visualization of our solar system, allowing users to explore planets, moons, and other celestial bodies directly in their browsers. Whether you're an astronomy enthusiast, educator, or developer, this project provides a dynamic platform to visualize and learn about the vastness of space.

Leveraging modern web technologies and a robust backend infrastructure, the Solar System Model ensures a seamless and engaging user experience. The application is designed with scalability and security in mind, making it suitable for both personal projects and educational platforms.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models:** Navigate through a detailed 3D representation of the solar system using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices to ensure accessibility across all platforms.
- **Real-Time Data:** Fetches and displays up-to-date information about celestial bodies via a RESTful API.
- **Secure Deployment:** SSL certificates managed by Certbot ensure secure data transmission.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy scaling and deployment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive controls and navigation enhance the overall user experience.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Efficient request handling with Nginx as a reverse proxy ensures quick load times and smooth interactions.
- **Extensible API:** Easily extendable backend services to incorporate additional features or data sources.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Interactive functionalities.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** 3D graphics library for rendering interactive models.

### Backend

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/):** High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework:** Toolkit for building Web APIs.

### DevOps

- **Docker:** Containerization platform for consistent environments.
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Nginx:** High-performance web server and reverse proxy.
- **Certbot (Let's Encrypt SSL):** Automated SSL certificate management.

### Hosting

- **VPS Server from [Beget](https://beget.com/):** Reliable hosting with specifications:
  - 2 CPU cores
  - 2GB RAM
  - 30GB SSD

## Architecture

The Solar System Model follows a modular and scalable architecture, ensuring ease of maintenance and scalability. Here's an overview of the system architecture:

1. **Frontend:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend interacts with users, rendering 3D models using Three.js and communicating with the backend via RESTful APIs.
2. **Backend:** Powered by Django and Django REST Framework, the backend handles data management, API endpoints, and business logic.
3. **Containerization:** Docker containers encapsulate the frontend, backend, and other services, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
4. **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx serves as a reverse proxy, managing incoming requests, load balancing, and SSL termination.
5. **Database:** Utilizes PostgreSQL (or another chosen database) for storing data related to celestial bodies and user interactions.
6. **Security:** SSL certificates from Certbot secure data transmission, while Django's security features protect against common vulnerabilities.
